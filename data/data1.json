In the company of #Oakley, who had also been rescued by the big cat, Annie spent several months isolated from the other Raptors, forming an inseverable bond with the litter of their savior, particularly a young tiger they named Graou.

But years later, and even after having accomplished the impossible by crossing the Waterwall with the help of her sisters, the mystery remains: how can the archipelago move so quickly? Convinced that the answer could be found in the flooded caves of the main island, the sister dived down into the ocean depths, making use of her amazing free-diving skills. And once there, discovered something that no #Komboka before her had ever seen: the left eye of a sleeping giant. It was Griffonmor the Powerful, Ymirah’s brother, who had been banished by his father for having dared to transmit his power to mortals. And while his hair of lava fed the volcano, his steady breath deformed the rocky floor beneath the feet of the amazed yet terrified #Bahari. Ah, if only she had dared wake up the God of fire, she’d have been a truly worthy replacement of her father.",

His good and bad luck had turned him into something of a legend among the ship's company. This, Baka owed to his ability to trigger off every single death trap in the area and make it out in the one piece, though it is unclear how. Upon entering a lost mausoleum Baka came across a strange cube that opened into a dark hole and transported him to the Sakrohm temple. The little alien, delighted at first at having escaped from his thankless task, quickly faced disenchantment: his coming had been prophesied by Tara who handed him over to Belmundo. The latter then entrusted him with the mission of finding the map that would lead to the place of rebirth of the Great Dashra Sakrh. Off he goes on yet another series of suicidal tasks with the foul-smelling flabby smuggler to keep him company. Ugh!",

But it was really by chance that Byron, the good-for-nothing, should stumble across a book about the voodoo world of Los Santos.

Which is why he temporarily entered into the service of #Arawaka who needed an assistant as her last one had disappeared under grisly circumstances. And once he’s completed his apprenticeship, he's determined everyone should call him SIR Byron and bow their heads in his presence unless that is they want to be sacrificed to evil spirits!",

In fact, his prison sentence was a result of him trying to save a kitten on the verge of being knocked over, which ended up in the annihilation of an entire block! With the unfortunate cat dying (and Jean making a run for it), Capri accepted his sentence without a fight, on the condition that they sent him down with a make-up bag so he could at least keep up appearances. \r\nIt goes without saying that unlike the other prisoners who ended up as dinosaur fodder, Capri was not under much threat in the lost world with half the local creatures breaking their fangs on him. And in fact it took him less than a week to become the anti-predator par excellence. Well, of course! Baby dinosaurs are just such little cuties!",

But all this changed dramatically when a strange grey thing appeared in the sky only to crash land and burst into flames. Out of it emerged weird and wonderful creatures with loose orange skin. After having hunted one or two of them, Chopper soon realized that these creatures represented more than just a meal, in that they were able to organize themselves and use nature to their advantage, to say nothing of their strange habits. Without a doubt, they were a whole lot more interesting than her fellow creatures. So, she decided to dress herself in the remains of her victims’ clothes and go and extend a paw to them. The two clan chiefs quickly spotted she was a fairly unique dinosaur and decided she could be a very useful asset to them. \r\nAnd now she’s discovered Clint City, hunting has suddenly become a whole lot more fun !",

To do this, she created a machine that generated electricity at such high density that it could both stabilize the ore and melt the surrounding rock so as to then be able to retrieve it.",

With the peace restored, Bernardo “El Mariachi”, along with Mercurio, now provides the exhibition matches at the top of the Pile Tower with musical ambience. Most notable are his beautiful renditions of “Cielito Lindo” on the violin, while he simultaneously goes for a leglock that leaves his opponent paralysed and humiliated!",

Blessed by an incredibly lucky streak, he escaped near drowning and was gaily walking about the place the very next day, right under Ace’s nose. It was then that Waller saw his golden opportunity and leapt on it. His plan was to hire this happy-go-lucky guy and make him undertake death defying feats, while making gamblers bet on his chances of survival and in the process rake in mega-bucks.  And of course with Fairbanks being the world's biggest risk-taker this was just the kind of exciting, well-paid opportunity he’d been looking for to really put his lucky star to the test!",

The ravages of this highly explosive material were a real problem for the fire chief, who had to put all his past experience with Boomstock into action to create a material that was resistant to the ore’s strange flames.

The yetis then gave her the following choice: either join the clan and obtain the help of Tiwi LD to complete her project, or return to Clint City empty-handed. No one, apart from the Frozn clan, is allowed to use cryoplasma. For Friskah, the choice was easy…",

This little magician has come up with techniques that allow him to take full advantage of this stagnant power by retrieving its emanations and infusing them into toys. After a few fairly inconclusive attempts, he’s managed to fine-tune the various stages of the process and is now one of the mainstays of the personal manufacturing facility for King Death Adder.",

Landing like a meteorite, he cut through the water and then straight through the ocean's floor, before breaking through the magma and finally arising and set light to the Komboka volcano. Years later in the Magic Academy, the four Komboka sisters have asked for the #Skeelz's help to awaken the giant.

According to the dusty tome, only a disciple of Griffonmor can awake him, and with #Kenny Mt now dead, it seems that all hope was lost. Except that nothing's too difficult for #Kuwaka, who promptly decides to master for herself the mysteries of the sacred fire, under the expert guidance of #Caelus Cr! \r\nHowever, what the four sisters and the Professor don't realize is that the #Nightmares are already setting out for the Komboka archipelago, determined to use the powers of #Nero to turn #Griffonmor into a tool at the service of their clan...

So now in my current role as circuit judge between Purgatory and the Great Beyond, I know all there is to know about its inhabitants. And in my opinion they are all guilty and must atone for their sins as ghosts back on earth, where they must relive their deaths time and time again, before earning the right to eternal rest.

He can, if he wishes, cause any kind of metal to melt! Add to that a well-trained body and unyielding resolve and what you get is a war machine!\r\nThese powers endowed Karl with the attention, fame, fascination and freedom he had always aspired to.\r\nNo more need for the gangster act, being a badass superhero is far more exciting!\r\nLucas and Dixie have found a rather unconventional ally in him!",

    "description": "Regardless of how many crew members are available on the ship, some depths are simply out of the Piranas' reach. Such being the case of the Myriana Trench, Bloodh had the old worn out diving suit specifically pulled out of the ship's hold and the sailors draw straws in order to determine which one of them would go on a stroll across the seabed. Not exactly born under a lucky star, Kousto showed no surprise when he ended up being the one to have to traipse about the ocean floor with nothing but questionable equipment to ensure his safety. But his bad luck didn't end there: a strange, gigantic parasite got hold of him at the bottom of the trench, becoming one with him as well as the swimsuit. At first, Bloodh was reluctant to have it removed (especially if Dr Alma were to chop off his head in the process), then he realized that this creature had enhanced Kousto's effectiveness and intelligence. Now, if this symbiosis had turned out profitable, who was he to come in between the charming couple?",

So imagine her surprise when she discovered there was no adult Dodgeball league as it wasn’t thought to be a “real” sport”! However, refusing to be discouraged by this turn of events, the determined young lady presented character:330 with a rock solid plan so he would agree to give her the necessary funds to create an even more spectacular and technical version of Dodgeball.  \r\nAfter several experimental phases, the new version presented by LaFleur integrated a complex system of anti-gravity trampolines, requiring extreme agility, to benefit from the added speed and strength offered. It was the birth of Gravityball.",

Shameless pigeons, exploding tires and over-zealous firing systems in his engine have all become his daily bread. So the only way he’s found to avoid this bad luck is to get around on horseback.

    "description": "Before the invention of pillz and before Morphun, Clint City was a far more peaceful place. So peaceful that Jacob, a security guard in charge of protecting the members of the Government, felt like his job was pretty pointless. But gradually, his employers picked up on his intelligence, his unusual powers of deduction and his incredible memory… So, he went from being a simple body guard to becoming the confidant and then adviser to the most powerful, until his expertise made him utterly indispensable and a true…Leader. For him and his oldest daughter, everything should have been perfect, but they hadn’t banked on the Oculus, that was attracted by the recent invention of pillz and saw an opportunity to create conflict on this planet. Only, the Oculus needed servants: in search of a recruiter, they chose…his daughter. And then gave the role of strategist to none other than…Jacob. Having been given the gift of eternal life and the powers of Dounia, Jacob went on to become Memento, the omniscient being in charge of dividing all those recruited by his daughter. And the father and daughter, not knowing what had become of the other, both lost their minds serving a being that went beyond all human understanding… Can the Oculus ever be defeated?",

However, although the surrounding wildlife was rich in sacrificial reptiles, Moro wrongly concluded the goddess would prefer human flesh.  Finally, tired of all these useless corpses cluttering up the place, the Raptors’ second-in-command decided to tie Moro up during the day and only release him at night at a good distance from the camp so as to avoid losing any more important clan members. However, now he’s in Clint City, the hunting ground is a lot more suited to his crazed way of thinking.",

You’ve only got to think back to the time when he was lead singer of a small indie group called 'Asphalt’, rocking a moustache that even in those days was pretty retro and playing instruments from the backwoods of history. However, in the end he was dropped by his fellow group members who preferred to pursue more conventional solo careers. Fortunately, the Roots welcomed this strange character with open arms, and all was going well while he was happy to quietly sing round the camp fire… However, ever since he got into his “version” of archery to defend clan members, some fear he's really lost it this time round.",

But, before leaving, the creator developed one last program, which was able to make important decisions in his absence. Nega D was meant to act as the creator does. It held the power to judge if any other software was malfunctioning, and then, to force others (like #Aviria Ld) to take the necessary measures. A power greater than any other, able to determine between virtual life and death. For many years, everything was fine, and Nega D demonstrated itself to be a just ruler. But you know what they say: absolute power corrupts absolutely! In time, many human emotions (greed, desire for power, envy and boredom to name few) started transforming him.  Nega D started to yearn for power, to be able to personally control the programs around him. He started to absorb the abilities of the programs that he judged to be 'interesting', and to force Aviria Ld to eliminate the ones resisting him. But one day, sensing its corruption, Aviria Ld and the Kommandons revolted against him, imprisoning him temporarily and shutting down the virtual city. His name was erased from the memory of the other programs, who now recall him only as a virus... The Virus X. But now that Nega D is back, crazier, angrier and more powerful than ever, his aim is still the same. He wants nothing more than... FILE CORRUPT. System error 27854-B. Additional information not found.",

Disgusted with the situation, Pavel left his country and took up residence in Clint City where he decided to join the Sentinel. But Havok is a hard nut to crack especially when faced with such a dubious liability. But with good will, hard work and after relinquishing his old material and embarking on an intensive language course, Pavel quickly proved his worth and found missions worthy of his skill at slow motion jumps when under enemy fire!",

    "description": "Ever since he took his first steps, Ramar was destined to master the ancient martial art of Kalaripayattu. Agile, quick and tough, he quickly got to grips with all the traditional weapons before embarking on a journey of initiation across the world.  He finally ended up in Clint City which, according to legend, was home to the era’s greatest warriors. There, after a series of impressive duels, he was welcomed as an honorary pupil at the Fang Pi Clang Monastery. Nevertheless, he continued to scour the rooftops of Clint City, always on the lookout for new opponents with unusual fighting techniques that would allow him to fine tune his skills and become truly invincible.",
    "abilityLongDescription": "If the Attack of Ramar is equal or higher than the double of the opposing character's attack, the player controlling the character will win 4 Life points until he reaches a total of 16 Life points at the end of the round.",

Listening to the voices of the frozen cliff-faces led the young woman to an abandoned wolf-cub and an injured eagle, who she then decided to take under her wing. Now after five years of living and travelling with her new companions, Ruru feels sufficiently prepared to finally take on champion Aaron in the next Hunter Games.",

She finally ended up settling down in Clint City where she qualified as a doctor and studied how to combine the new medical technological advances with the knowledge she had acquired. However, faced with a refusal from the Clint City General Hospital to help her in her “unprofitable” research, she turned to the Rescue clan where she uncovered a team of true enthusiasts with whom she managed to create new remedies, despite the presence of slightly dubious practitioners like Pastor.",

Having undergone many - unsuccessful - executions by electric chair, being dumped in the Lost World's swamps in the middle of a school of prehistoric eels was not about to put an end to this dangerous maniac's doings. For the experience of all these electric shocks has led Shaker to fuse with them and enabled him to develop an extraordinary strength that proves very useful when it comes to snapping a basic reptile's neck. Taking all of this in, #Rex Sweig decided he was not about to pass up the opportunity to use this to his best advantage. He had a kind of living battery filled with swamp eels fixed on Shaker's back, who is now continuously powered, making him extremely dangerous at all times.",

It was only after a dual with Katan, who left her with an ugly scar across her face as a souvenir, that she finally earned the respect of Bloodh. Having since been promoted to matron-in-chief, she lambasts the Piranas' oarsmen by singing \"You are a Pirate\" along with the rest of the crew, in time to the strokes of her whip.",

In fact, she was probably the most pure-hearted person alive in Clint City.

This was how Tara came to be vested with the grace of the multidimensional being and now illuminates the clan’s devotees with her transcendental wisdom. This turn of events couldn’t help but irritate those disciples who’d been around for longer than her. However, they quickly realized that being at the receiving end of the mental batterings meted out by Tara’s deadly smile didn’t leave much room for discussion!",

However, one look at his extremely limited equipment and most of the Ulu Watu members had exchanged knowing smiles. Other than a few clintz, a couple of cans lying around and a dozing Stanly, Wooly didn't manage to dig up much.

It has to be said that Zaria had been locked up instead of her boyfriend for a crime she hadn’t committed and was not naturally a very combative person. Fortunately, in extreme and desperate situations one’s survival instinct can suddenly kick in to reveal a true force of nature. Reappearing in the survivors’ makeshift camp a week after the crash, she took on a ferocious raptor with her bare hands and subjected it to her will. Of course this show of strength earned her the definitive respect of the most hard-faced of her fellow convicts. \r\nThe fragile prisoner was all but dead and gone and in her place a merciless warrior had been born!",
